# compressGather
Some compression algorithms for common types
Including integer compression algorithm,both positive and negative Numbers are common reference zig 7bit.
Lossless compression of floating point Numbers reference gorilla paper encoding.
Lossy compression of floating point Numbers, you need to pass in a few decimal places, Floating-point compression is currently supported only type float, Lossy compression reuse integer method.
